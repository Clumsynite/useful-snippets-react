# Useful Snippets for React

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of useful code snippets for React, aimed at helping developers improve their productivity and efficiency when working with React projects.

## Contents

The Project has routes for the different components on the specific functionality or feature they address. Here is a brief overview of the contents:

  1. [**Password Generator**](/#/password-generator):  The Password Generator component is a reusable React component that generates random passwords. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for generating passwords with customizable length and complexity. Users can specify the length of the password and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Upon generating a password, it is displayed to the user and can be copied to the clipboard for easy use.

  2. [**Bcrypt Encryptor**](/#/bcrypt): The Bcrypt Encryptor component is a React component that utilizes the Bcrypt hashing algorithm to securely encrypt passwords or sensitive data. Bcrypt is a popular and widely used algorithm for password hashing, known for its security and resistance to brute-force attacks. This component provides an easy-to-use interface for users to enter their data and encrypt it using Bcrypt. The encrypted result can then be used for storage or transmission, ensuring that sensitive information is securely protected.

  3. [**Card Scroll**](/#/card-scroll) : The Card Scroll component is a React component that implements a card-based scrolling functionality. It is designed to display a collection of cards or items in a horizontal scrollable container. Users can navigate through the cards by scrolling horizontally, making it ideal for showcasing images, products, or other content in a visually appealing manner. The Card Scroll component provides a responsive and interactive user experience, allowing users to view and interact with the cards on both desktop and mobile devices.
     1. [**Horizontal Scroll**](/#/card-scroll#scroll1): Continuous Scroll Indicator for Cards that don&apos;t take up full width, to highlight the section of cards currently in view

     2. [**Horizontal Scroll 2**](/#/card-scroll#scroll2): Scroll Indicator to indicate which card is currently in view

  4. [**Calendar**](/#/calendar): The Simple React Month Calendar UI is a lightweight and user-friendly React component that provides a clean and intuitive interface for displaying and navigating through a month-based calendar. This component allows users to view a single month at a time and easily switch between different months and years. The Simple React Month Calendar UI displays the days of the month in a grid layout, with each day represented by a cell. It highlights the current day. Users can navigate forward or backward through months using arrow buttons or swipe gestures on touch-enabled devices. This allows for seamless exploration of different months. The component can be easily integrated into React projects and customized to match the desired visual style. It provides hooks or callbacks to handle user interactions or retrieve selected dates, allowing developers to incorporate the calendar into their application logic. Overall, the Simple React Month Calendar UI is a straightforward and versatile component that offers a basic yet effective solution for displaying and interacting with month-based calendars in React applications.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
